i have a lot of things to do, i need to make priority

first, i'm happy to use chinese for writing, it will hard and slow to use english, but if i use english a month, or a year, what will happen!

1. cocos2d-x 3.0
	a prefect 2d game engineer, i can use it to develop game and learn a lot of skills contain the follows.

2. lua
	lua is a newer for me, which can create logic use script, it's prefect for updating game from server.
	
3. reflection
	c++ don't have reflection, but if you want to translate data to object, or in return, reflection will provide help you can't to say no.
	
4. resource manager, 
	png, swf, wav and so on, i need to manage to make app size more small, memory more less.
	
5. event manager
	it can make the program pretty and clear.

6. network communication like protobuf
	you must need communication with server if you want to developer a network game which will be more prospect, protobuf is a prefect framework to do it.

7. socket and http
	network game will need it, i will need some basic skills.

8. jni
	it's a bridge between c++ to java. if you develop game for android, it will be helpful.	
	
9. opengl es
	all mobile games is base on opengl es, i have heared it's hard to learn, but it's just a skill, and so many people can use it, what's the hard!

maybe there are some more i need learn, but i need learn one by one, if some skill come to my mind, i will adjust the priority.
